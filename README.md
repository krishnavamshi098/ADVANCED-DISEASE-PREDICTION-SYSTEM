# ADVANCED-DISEASE-PREDICTION-SYSTEM

Disease prediction from symptoms.

-> Problem Statement: 
1.Classical diagnosis method is a process where the patient has to visit a doctor, undergo various medical test and then come to a conclusion.
2.This process is very time consuming.

-> Our Solution:
1.To save the time required and also money for initial process of diagnosis symptoms, this project proposes an automated disease prediction sysem that relies on user input.
2.The system takes input from user and provides a list of probable diseases.

-> More about project: 
1.Disease will be predicted using Naive Bayesian algorithm which works on probabilistic approach more specifically Multinomial NB since multiple symptoms are taken.
2.According to literature survey, this algorithm results in maximum accuracy for larger dataset.
3.The dataset contains disease as labels and for each disease symptoms are given.

-> Training.csv:
This is the main dataset which has been used in this project. This dataset consist of mainly two columns "Disease" and "Symptoms" but this dataset is preprocessed so it helps in easily clasifying the data. This dataset is used to train our model.

-> Testing.csv:
This is the dataset which has been used to test our model so that we can know the accuracy of our model. this dataset is predefined with output.
